 Coin Counting:
 Given an infinite number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, write code to calculate the number of possible ways of giving exact change for n cents.

 In other words, write a function called coinCombos that takes in one argument: n, which represents the total amount of money (in cents) that you need to make change for. Your function should return the amount of possible combinations you can make to return that exact amount of change.

 For example:

 coinCombos(5); //returns 2
 coinCombos(10); //returns 4
 coinCombos(25); //returns 13
 coinCombos(60); //returns 73
 
 Question for ourselves: what is the base case?
 for zero cents, there are no combinations
 for one cent, there is one combination
 ...
 for four cents, there is one combo
 for five cents, there are two combos (5 penny or 1 nickle)
 ...
 for nine cents, there are two combos
 for ten cents, there are four combos (1 dime, 2 nickles, 1 nickle + 5 pennies, 10 pennies)
 ...
 for fifteen cents, there are six combos (15 pennies, 10 pennies + 1 nickle, 5 pennies + 1 dime, 5 pennies + 2 nickles, 3 nickles, 1 nickle + 1 dime)
 
 There's a pattern???
 More combinations as input gets larger
 Each time we add the value of another coin that's NOT a penny, there are more combinations
 
 Recursively: The number of combinations of coins to get a particular change amount is equal to (pattern above) for some smaller subset.
 25 -> quarter, and any other combos that dont use a quarter
 25 -> quarter, and the dime combinations, and combinations that dont use a dime or quarter
 25 -> quarter, and the dime (with no quarters) combos, and the nickle (with no quarters or dimes) combos, and the penny-only combo

 Trees -> Combine a ton of DSA concepts
 - kind of look like a Linked List - different because they can point in many directions. In a LL, a node has a next (pointing to one node), in a Tree a node has children (pointing to many nodes).
 - Whereas a LL is for order (this, this.next is the next thing in our list), a Tree is used to represent HIERARCHY!
 - node has children. Those children have a "parent" node. Each "generation" in the tree is a level. Very top of the tree is the root. Bottom parts of the tree are the leaves.
 - root knows its children, which know their children, which know their children... until there are no more children for a given node. That means... a given child doesn't know what it's parent is (like in a LL, this.next doesn't know what "this" is). Can only go down a tree from a given node
 
 LL:
a -> b -> c -> d -> e
 
 Tree:
      a
    /  \
   b     c
  /\    / \
 d  f  g   e
 
 // Because there are branches, like in a flow chart, i can only access the nodes available from the node i'm currently at. Moving around = "traversing"
 // Since I can't get to all nodes in one branch (unless it's really sparse), there are whole algorithms built around traversing trees.
 
 // 2 categories of traversal algos: Breadth-first, depth-first
 // Breadth-first looks at all the nodes on a given level (starting at the root) before going to the nodes on the next level
 // Depth-first looks at all the nodes on one branch (going down to the leaves) before looking at the next branch. Typically, we traverse to the left before the right
 // We store stuff in trees so that instead of retrieving them in linear time (like in a LL) we can get the back in O(log n)
 
 // Tree with node that has left/right nodes is called a Binary Tree
 // On a binary tree, our ideal would be to be able to search for things in O(log n) time.
 */

// A huge goal of ours for using trees is that we want to be able to move things around based on >, <, >=, <=, and ==

// Base case for most recursive tree functions will be if the node is nil... variants might be to see if the left/right are nil.
// Recursive call in recursive functions for trees is usually the same function for the left and right side.
// Because from any node there are at most two children in Binary Tree, there's a lot of "either-or"

// Practice:
// 1: Find the left-most node (leaf) in a tree
// 2: Using DFS, find the largest value in a tree
// 3: Swap all leaves (on their parent) in a tree
